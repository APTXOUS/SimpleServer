SimpleSocket is a toy socket server project based on Linux socket.

We have use this library to compete these projects:

1. [One Room](https://github.com/kagaya85/OneRoom): A PC chatting software using Qt as user interface and SimpleSocket as backend.
2. [Game Server](https://github.com/TaihouDaisuki/GameSever): A plane game backend progream. The game client is here:[AircraftWarClient](https://github.com/kagaya85/AircraftWarClient)
3. Analog bank teller communication protocol. 

All of those are course projects, so we need time to divide the SimpleSocket library from those projects.
